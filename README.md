Roman2.0 – The Smart Voice & Gesture-Controlled Assistant

Roman2.0 is an AI-powered assistant built on Raspberry Pi 4 that lets you control music playback using voice commands and hand gestures. It combines:

Voice Control – Speak commands to play, pause, skip, or adjust volume.
Gesture Recognition – A custom-trained neural network (using a subset of the HaGRID dataset) detects intuitive hand gestures for touch-free control. https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid
