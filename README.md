Roman2.0 â€“ Intelligent Assistant
An intelligent assistant built with Raspberry Pi 4 that lets users control music using voice commands and hand gestures. It features a custom-trained neural network for gesture recognition and a Flask web application that interacts with the Spotify Web API to manage playback seamlessly.

For this project I've been using part of HaGRID dataset: https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid
